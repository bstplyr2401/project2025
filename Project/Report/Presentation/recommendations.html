<h3>Comparison Between Spain and Ireland in 2023</h3>
<p>In 2023, the percentage of renewable electricity in Spain was <strong>50.34%</strong>, 
while in Ireland it was <strong>43.71%</strong>.</p>

<h3>Long-Term Trends</h3>
<p>Over the past 4 years, Spain has had an average annual growth of <strong>1.59%</strong> in renewable energy, 
while Ireland has grown at a rate of <strong>0.46%</strong> per year.</p>

<h3>Recommendations Based on These Findings</h3>
<ul>
    <li>Spain’s renewable energy growth rate (<strong>1.59%</strong>) is significantly higher than Ireland’s (<strong>0.46%</strong>), with a difference of <strong>1.13%</strong> per year. This suggests that Spain’s policies and investments are yielding stronger results, while Ireland may need to accelerate its transition effrots.</li>

    <li>Spain should continue investing in wind and solar energy to sustain its higher-than-average 
        growth rate of <strong>1.59%</strong> per year.</li>
    
    <li>Ireland needs to accelerate its transition, as its growth rate of <strong>0.46%</strong> per year 
        is significantly lower than Spain's.</li>

    <li>Grid modernization is crucial for both countries: Spain should invest in smart grids to manage 
        its increasing renewable share, while Ireland should expand its storage capacity to stabilize supply.</li>

    <li>Policy alignment with EU targets: Spain is on track but should ensure long-term sustainability, 
        while Ireland must introduce stronger incentives to increase its renewable share more rapidly.</li>

    <li>Public and private sector collaboration: Spain can attract further investments due to its high growth, 
        while Ireland needs policies that encourage faster adoption of renewables.</li>
</ul>
